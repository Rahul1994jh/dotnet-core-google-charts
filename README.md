# dotnet-core-google-charts

This is just a demo app made for fun with no focus on code maintainabilty at all, it is just a poc.

1. open dotnet-core-google-charts/ChartDataApi/GoogleCharts/GoogleCharts.csproj in vscode or visual studio

2. run the project with docker, iis or just as lib - (get the url)

3. go to dotnet-core-google-charts/ClientReactApp/

4. check App.js in src folder - dotnet-core-google-charts/ClientReactApp/src/App.js

5. update url in  const url = "http://localhost:35677/api/SalesVisualizer" from step 1

I am not a Front end expert, in fact i have not done any frontend work in last 4 years, so took some time today to see how cool would be giving face to backend app

I have been a backend developer for last 7 years with specializing in creating backend API's, Microservices with full unit and integration tests following best architectures based on requirements such as DDD ETC. 
I am fosuing on becoming a full stack software developer this year though i love doing backend system more.
